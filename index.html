        <h1>What is it?</h1>

<p>This game was a project for a game programming class that I took Spring 2012 at the University of Tulsa.

<h1>Why is it?</h1>

<p>I had been playing Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time which gave me the idea for this game. The basic concept (ripped shamelessly from Rachet and Clank, and, from what I hear, Braid): You do normal platform-y stuff. However, you can also record your actions and play them back, effectively enabling you to be in two places at the same time. Ratchet and Clank used this mechanic to balance out the 3rd-person-shooter action with a slower, more cerebral vibe. The puzzles included, however, were never really intellectually taxing (with the exception of the extra levels unlocked upon completion of the game). With this in mind (and the fact that I did not, at the time, know of a 2D game with this kind of mechanic, like Braid), I decided to make a game that could...</p>

<ol>
<li>Bring this fun concept into a 2D platformer.</li>
<li>Enable me (or any user) to make additional levels more easily.</li>
<li>Get me a good grade.</li>
</ol><h1>What do I need to run it?</h1>

<p>This game was written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and uses the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">pygame engine</a>. Thus, both Python and pygame need to be installed to run this game.</p>

<p>I am considering using <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/">py2exe</a> to package it all into a nice executable, but I see no pressing need to do this at the current time.</p>

<h1>Who else helped with it?</h1>

<p>Special thanks to Lauren Foreman, Jon Teel, Charlie Walter, and Blake Burkhart (<a href="https://github.com/bburky" class="user-mention">@bburky</a>) for their assistance with this project.</p>
